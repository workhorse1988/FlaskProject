Water Supplies

Collapse
Chapter 5 contains the minimum requirements for the various water supply sources that provide water to sprinkler systems. The effectiveness of any sprinkler system design depends on the adequacy of its water supply in terms of its ability to provide the required demand for flow and pressure when needed. A failure of the system to control or suppress a fire can result in significant damage or loss of property and possible loss of life. Unless the sprinkler system discharge criteria can be satisfied by the water supply in terms of pressure, flow, and duration, the system will not perform as intended. Sprinkler system design considerations, such as sprinkler spacing, hazard classification, design density, and pipe sizes, will have little or no influence without sufficient water.

In the United States and Canada, municipal water systems often are robust, with distribution piping sized large enough to provide adequate water supplies to satisfy the demand for many water-based fire protection systems, without the need for fire pumps and/or water storage tanks. In some cases—usually where systems are being designed for facilities outside the United States and Canada—listed fire pumps and water storage tanks typically are required.

In many cases, efforts are made to design a sprinkler system so that an existing water supply can adequately supply the system’s demand, that is, larger pipes or sprinklers with larger K-factors are selected so that the system demand will not exceed the water supply capacity. If the water supply, which includes pressure, flow, and capacity (duration times flow) components, is deficient, supplemental measures to increase the water supply will be necessary for proper system operation. In some situations, a fire pump could be needed to compensate for a lack of pressure even if a sufficient volume of water is available. In other cases, such as a large industrial complex, the installation of a gravity tank could be needed to provide the necessary water supply capacity.

To determine the appropriate water supply source, consideration should be given to the ability of the local fire department to perform final extinguishment. Most sprinkler system designs in NFPA 13 are intended to control a fire event until the local fire department completes the final extinguishment. However, some facilities may be more difficult for the local fire department to achieve final extinguishment due to a facility’s location, the intricate layout of a building’s interior, or complex manufacturing processes. These potential difficulties and their impact on final extinguishment could result in a decision by the design engineer or the authority having jurisdiction to increase the duration of the water supply for the sprinkler system.

The proper maintenance of the water supplies for sprinkler systems is critical and is addressed in ﻿﻿NFPA 25﻿﻿, Standard for the Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems. It is also important to evaluate the impact of retroactive installation of pressure-reducing valves or backflow devices on the design of an existing sprinkler system. These devices have the potential to reduce the pressure to a point where a water supply that was previously sufficient is no longer capable of adequately supplying the sprinkler system.

5.1 General.
5.1.1 Number of Supplies.
Every automatic sprinkler system shall have at least one automatic water supply.

FAQ

Where a building requires multiple sprinkler systems, how many water supplies are required?

The intent of 5.1.1 is that a water supply be provided that will be sufficient to supply the activation of any single sprinkler system. Therefore, only one water supply is required for a single building.

FAQ 

What does the term automatic water supply mean?

The term automatic water supply means that the activation of the water supply does not depend on human intervention.

It is not necessary for a single water supply source to be sized to account for the simultaneous operation of all systems. The water supply must be capable of meeting the most hydraulically demanding area of the systems. If a building’s size requires that it have three separate sprinkler systems, each system is not required to be connected to its own water supply. Instead, the water supply must be capable of meeting the demands of the hydraulically most demanding areas of the three systems. NFPA 13 assumes that only one fire will occur in a building at any given time and that the sprinkler system will control the fire before it spreads to adjacent portions of the building.

5.1.2 Capacity.
Water supplies shall be capable of providing the required flow and pressure for the remote design area determined using the requirements and procedures as specified in Chapters 19 through 27 including hose stream allowance where applicable for the required duration.

Enhanced Content

As with all components critical to the effective operation of the sprinkler system, water supply sources must be reliable. The sources must be capable of meeting the system demand at all times. Regardless of how well the sprinkler system was designed and installed, if the water supply fails, the sprinkler system will fail. If the water supply is taken from a municipal waterworks system, potential future degradation of water supply conditions, as well as seasonal and daily fluctuations, must be considered.

Additionally, waterflow tests should be conducted on a routine basis to monitor the condition of the water supply. Over time, water supply systems are likely to be degraded by pipe corrosion, scale buildup, and inadvertently closed or partially closed valves. The impact of future users of the water supply also must be evaluated. In addition, if water supplies employ fire pumps or water storage tanks, that equipment is subject to certain requirements to maintain its reliability. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 25﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ further requires that specific inspection, testing, and maintenance activities be conducted to ensure the integrity of the water supply.

Where a waterworks system serves as the sprinkler system’s water supply, ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿19.2.3﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ requires that the supply be of sufficient capacity to meet the sprinkler system’s discharge criteria, any inside hose demand where such equipment is provided, and a waterflow allowance for outside hose. Paragraph ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿19.1.6.2﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ requires the outside hose allowance to be added either at the connection to the water main or at a yard hydrant, whichever is closer.

Regardless of its arrangement, the underground supply must have sufficient capacity to satisfy the calculated system demand, based on the selected design approach from Chapter ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿19﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ or Chapter ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿24﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿, the protection requirements from Chapters ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿20﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ through ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿23﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ and Chapter ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿25﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿, and the occupancy requirements from Chapter ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿27﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿. NFPA 13 requires fire pumps and water storage tanks to be sized based on the systems they serve, but in all cases, the supply must require no human intervention to operate and must be capable of supplying the system for the necessary duration.

ASK THE AHJ

Can the authority having jurisdiction require a safety margin between the system demand and the water supply curve?

Per NFPA 13, if the water supply curve is accurate and accounts for all conditions that could affect the flows and pressures available to the fire sprinkler system, the answer is no. This does not mean that the local jurisdiction cannot legally adopt an amendment requiring a safety margin, because there are several jurisdictions that have done just that.

As explained in the commentary to Section ﻿﻿﻿1.1﻿﻿﻿, NFPA 13 specifies a set of minimum standards. If the owner wants to avoid potentially costly water supply upgrades in the future because of natural deterioration, the system designer should inform the owner of such implications if the system demand is near or on the water supply curve. There might be more cost-effective ways to design the system with a safety margin when the system is originally installed, rather than the owner having to do retrofits later in the life of the building. It is also worth noting that the minimum system demand calculations of the standard build in safety factors. These safety factors include, but are not necessarily limited to, design areas that are much larger than the typical area of sprinklers activated in most fire scenarios, the assumption that discharge densities near the fire will match those in the design calculations rather than the much higher densities that are typically produced by the first few activated sprinklers, and the typical use of the total pressure approach to friction loss calculations.

However, once the system demand is determined using NFPA 13, that system demand is fixed for the life of the system, and that is the flow/pressure with which an authority having jurisdiction will enforce the system maintenance requirements. In other words, if the system demand is designed to be exactly on the water supply curve today and there is any future deterioration of the water supply, the owner will be responsible for implementing changes so the system demand is properly supplied, whether it entails providing a new supply or improving the existing water supply. There is no tolerance to the water supply deterioration in NFPA 25 when comparing the water supply curve to the system demand—there is only a tolerance to the present water supply curve as it compares to the water supply curve results of prior tests. Too often, the authority having jurisdiction sees the owner incurring huge costs because the installing contractor decided to save on upfront costs and the owners were not properly informed of the ramifications of doing so.

ASK THE SYSTEM DESIGNER 

After a flow test has been performed to determine the strength of the water supply, does a safety factor or safety margin need to be applied to account for daily and seasonal fluctuations?

While NFPA 13 and ﻿﻿NFPA 24﻿﻿, Standard for the Installation of Private Fire Service Mains and Their Appurtenances, do not require a specific safety factor or safety margin, one should be applied. The amount of safety margin to apply is complex and difficult to codify into a standard adopted by law. This is one of the reasons that evaluation of the water supply is an engineering function. Some of the variables involved include the following:

Time of day and season in which the flow test was conducted
Typical usage in the water supply
Maturity of the water supply (potential for the community to grow significantly)
Number of sprinklers in the design area
Other assumptions in the sprinkler system design
After a flow test has been conducted, the water utility company can be contacted to see how the pressure in the area goes up and down over days and seasons. NFPA 25 considers a sprinkler system on a broken main as impaired and gives the building owner options to provide temporary water supplies, add fire watches, or evacuate the building. With a better understanding of NFPA rules, water utility companies might be willing to collaborate with NFPA to develop appropriate adjustments to water supply flow tests.

Another issue with the potential adjustment to the water supply flow test is that the responsibility lies with the specifying engineer. According to the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE) and their position on the practice of fire protection engineering, it is the specifying engineer’s job to evaluate the water supply and apply appropriate safety factors. But many times, the engineers push the task back on the sprinkler contractor, who does not have the information necessary to make adjustments.

Many local authorities having jurisdiction require a 10 psi (0.7 bar) safety margin or a 10 percent safety factor between the sprinkler system demand and the water supply. This is, in effect, a reduction of the water supply from the flow test data. While the safety margin/factor is enforceable, it might not be sufficient in some cases and it might be too much in others. Until NFPA 13 can address this issue across the board, some sort of adjustment should be factored into the information from a water supply flow test.

5.1.3* Size of Fire Mains.
5.1.3.1 
Except as provided in 5.1.3.2 or 5.1.3.3, no pipe smaller than 6 in. (150 mm) in diameter shall be installed as a private service main.

Sizes smaller than 6 in. (150 mm) for fire mains that do not supply hydrants shall be permitted, provided that hydraulic calculations show the main will supply the total demand at the appropriate pressure.

Enhanced Content
Collapse
Private fire service mains must be at least 6 in. (150 mm) in diameter where they supply hydrants. In some cases, the use of a minimum 8 in. (200 mm) pipe for dead-end mains is advised. Where the fire service mains do not supply hydrants, they are permitted to be sized based on hydraulic calculations, or they are permitted to be as large as the riser under certain conditions. Fire mains need a water supply sufficient to meet the demands of the sprinkler systems, inside hose, outside hose, and other anticipated water demands.

5.1.3.3 
Where a single main less than 4 in. (100 mm) in diameter serves both fire systems and other uses, the non-fire demand shall be added to the hydraulic calculations for the fire system at the point of connection unless provisions have been made to automatically isolate the non-fire demand during a fire event.

Enhanced Content
Collapse
Simultaneous flow of the non-fire water and automatic sprinkler systems must be considered when small diameter [i.e., less than 4 in. (100 mm)] combination lead-ins are used. The additional non-fire waterflow can create increased friction loss, resulting in a reduction in the water available for the sprinkler system.

The term non-fire is used to emphasize that any water that is flowing needs to be accounted for whether it is being used for domestic use or other uses.


5.1.3.4 
For pipe schedule systems, the underground supply pipe shall be at least as large as the system riser.

5.1.4* Water Supply Treatment.

5.1.4.1 Water Supplies and Environmental Conditions.

5.1.4.1.1 
Water supplies and environmental conditions shall be evaluated for the existence of microbes and conditions that contribute to microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC).


5.1.4.1.2 
Where conditions that contribute to MIC are found, the owner(s) shall notify the sprinkler system installer and develop a plan to treat the system using one of the following methods:
(1)
Install system piping that will not be affected by the MIC microbes

(2)
Treat all water that enters the system using a listed bacterial inhibitor

(3)
Implement an approved plan for monitoring the interior conditions of the pipe at established time intervals and locations

(4)
Install a corrosion monitoring station and monitor at established intervals


Enhanced Content
Collapse
Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) is caused, in part, by microorganisms in the water supply that react with system piping. MIC can result in the formation of deposits and pitting of system piping in a relatively short period of time.

Over the past several years, additional data on the effects of MIC have become available. MIC can cause severe problems with metallic pipe in areas with specific water supply and system factors. The provisions of 5.1.4.1.2 are intended to guard against the effects of MIC on sprinkler system performance when the sprinkler system is installed. MIC can cause ongoing damage to system piping, so follow-up evaluation and treatment of the water supply likely will be necessary once the system is in service.


5.1.4.2 Corrosion.

5.1.4.2.1 
Water supplies and environmental conditions shall be evaluated for conditions that contribute to unusual corrosive properties.


5.1.4.2.2 
Where conditions are found that contribute to unusual corrosive properties, the owner(s) shall notify the sprinkler system installer and a plan shall be developed to treat the system using at least one of the following methods:
(1)
Install system piping that is corrosion resistant

(2)
Treat water that enters the system using a listed corrosion inhibitor

(3)
Implement an approved plan for monitoring the interior conditions of the pipe at established intervals and locations

(4)
Install approved corrosion monitoring stations and monitor at established intervals

FAQ

Is it acceptable to use plastic pipe for the transition to the sprinkler system piping?

Many types of pipe acceptable for use as underground fire service mains are limited to conditions involving belowgrade applications only. As a result, steel, iron, or copper pipe materials are typically used for the transition piece; however, any piping approved for underground installation is acceptable as long as it is protected against possible damage from corrosive agents, solvent attack, or mechanical damage.

5.1.5.1.2 
Where required due to specific mechanical or environmental conditions, the transition piece shall be protected against possible damage from corrosive agents, solvent attack, or mechanical damage.

FAQ

When backflow prevention devices are installed, what pressure losses must be accounted for?

Where installed, the pressure loss through a backflow prevention device must be accounted for, and the valves on the device must be supervised like any other system control valve. If a backflow prevention device is installed retroactively, the pressure loss through the additional pipe and fittings used in conjunction with the prevention device also must be taken into account. For further details, see ﻿﻿﻿16.14.5﻿﻿﻿. In addition, the backflow prevention device must be properly inspected, tested (including forward flow at system demand), and maintained to ensure proper operation.

FAQ 

Are backflow prevention devices required by NFPA 13?

The most common type of equipment used to guard against possible contamination of the public water supply is a listed backflow prevention device. These devices typically affect the system’s hydraulic characteristics and are a potential point of system impairment if performance is not properly monitored.

Backflow prevention devices are not a requirement of NFPA 13 and serve no benefit to the sprinkler system. Backflow prevention devices are typically required by public health authorities for non–fire protection purposes.

Although not specifically mentioned, suction tanks (see Exhibit 5.1), embankment supported tanks, wells, and ponds could also be considered as water supply sources for automatic sprinkler systems. Along with the other water supply sources identified, these sources must be reliable and have enough capacity to meet the sprinkler system demand at all times.

When water supplies other than circulating public waterworks systems are used, the proper installation of system components, such as piping, pumps, or tanks, should be verified. Even though private systems are designed to provide adequate water capacity, flow, and pressure, the reliability of these systems must be monitored through the implementation of a periodic inspection, testing, and maintenance program and through the proper supervision of certain system components. Public systems are tested and supervised continually by the daily demands placed on them. Private systems can remain idle for longer periods of time.

If a waterworks system is contemplated for the supply source, the associated water supply test data must have been obtained no more than 12 months prior to submittal of the working plan. Peak loads on the system, as well as any seasonal fluctuations and likely interruptions of waterflow, must be contemplated. When a waterworks system is being considered, the least amount of water in terms of pressure and flow available should be used as the water supply, because the sprinkler system demand must be met 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

5.2.2* Connections to Waterworks Systems.
5.2.2.1 
A connection to a reliable waterworks system shall be an acceptable water supply source.

Enhanced Content
Collapse
Designers and engineers should include a certain margin between the water supply and the system demand to account for future use or deterioration of the water supply. For instance, the construction of additional buildings drawing water from a common municipal supply can negatively affect the available water supply. Such a situation could result in a sprinkler system deficiency, because the water supply no longer meets the system demand. Designers and engineers who do not leave a margin between the system demand and the water supply to account for potential building development run an increased risk of having an inadequate sprinkler system in the future.

In addition, some areas can develop critical water shortages during certain times of the year, causing some water purveyors to initiate water supply reduction programs. In other cases, available water distribution system pressures and flows are intentionally reduced by trimming pumps and valves, which results in lower static and residual pressures. A safety factor increases the likelihood that these systems will perform adequately if gradual reductions in the water supply occur during the life of the sprinkler system. An appropriate size for the safety factor takes into account the existing water supply and any anticipated future development of the site.

Gravity tanks are not as common as they were years ago. The availability of a wider range of fire pump capacities in terms of flow-pressure combinations has made pumps a more desirable option in many cases.

If gravity tanks are used, they must be of a capacity that satisfies the system discharge requirements of Chapter ﻿﻿﻿﻿19﻿﻿﻿﻿ through Chapter ﻿﻿26﻿﻿. If gravity tanks are also used to supply domestic or industrial needs, the arrangement must be such that the entire volume of water needed for fire protection is available when and after other demands have been placed on the tank. These tanks often include underground private water supply piping, such as the one shown in Exhibit 5.8. For that reason, in addition to referencing ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 22﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿, Standard for Water Tanks for Private Fire Protection, for the tank installation, ﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 24﻿﻿﻿﻿ also must be referenced for the installation of underground piping.
