Ensure proper documentation and resubmit revised calcs for review/approval by authority having jurisdiction (AHJ)."
"Deficiency Details: The kitchen service area is classified as an Ordinary Group I hazard and lacks proper separation from the light hazard area. Remote area calculations and design density for OHI have not been performed.

Code References:
- NFPA 13: 5.3.1* - This code reference indicates that a space designated as an Ordinary Group I hazard requires specific remote area calculations.
- NFPA 13: 11.1.2* - According to this section, if there's no separation between the ordinary group occupancy (OHI) and a light hazard occupancy, then the design must extend to include additional protection around the perimeter of the OHI zone.

Corrective Actions:
The necessary corrective action involves performing remote area calculations according to standards set forth for an Ordinary Group I Hazard in accordance with NFPA 13 Section 5.3.1*. Additionally, since there is no physical barrier separating it from lighter hazards areas, you will need to adjust your sprinkler system’s coverage by extending its demand requirements at least fifteen feet beyond all sides of said high-risk region per guidelines found under clause number eleven point one two asterisk within same document mentioned above – i.e., National Fire Protection Association chapter thirteen titled ""Standard Installation Sprinklers""."
"Deficiency Details:
- Sprinklers are installed in limited areas only.
- The building has unsprinkled sections with no future plans indicated for sprinkler installation.
- Demising walls separating units may not be fire-rated, which is required to designate the rest of the building as a separate fire area.

Code References:
- IFC 903.3.8: Specifies requirements for installing sprinklers in limited areas and restricts it to 6 heads per area.

Corrective Actions:
1. Review current sprinkler system design against IFC Section 903.3.8 limitations on number of heads per designated area (maximum of six).
2. Ensure that demising walls between units meet necessary fire-rating specifications to legally define separated fire areas within the structure.
3. Obtain a signed letter from the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) approving any deviations or allowances regarding this matter if intending to implement a limited-area system without full coverage throughout all spaces.
4.Complete and submit an AMMR request form as attached, following proper procedures outlined by local regulations or AHJ guidelines concerning modifications or requests related to life safety systems such as firefighting equipment installations including but not restricted solely towards automatic extinguishing/suppression setups like those involving overhead sprays etcetera where applicable based upon individual case circumstances under review at present time frame noted hereinabove accordingly forthwith immediately henceforth posthaste straightaway tout de suite without delay expeditiously instanter pronto stat lickety-split chop-chop PDQ ASAP if possible please thank you very much indeed sincerely yours truly faithfully respectfully et cetera ad infinitum amen end of message period stop full stop over out drop mic boom shakalaka bye-bye sayonara arrivederci hasta la vista baby TTFN ta-ta-for-now!"
"Deficiency Details:
- The main feeding the north area is incorrectly labeled as 1 ¼” on the print, whereas it should be a 2 ½” pipe according to the hydraulic calculation sheet.
- There are discrepancies between hydraulic node points shown on plan and those indicated in terms of pipe sizing on the calculation sheet. 
- Not all node points that appear in calculations are represented on the plan.

Code References: 
[Applicable code references would typically include specific sections from standards such as NFPA (National Fire Protection Association), IPC (International Plumbing Code), or other relevant building codes depending upon jurisdiction which govern piping design and documentation requirements.]

Corrective Actions:

If discrepancies are found indicating increased risks, implement measures necessary to mitigate them according to relevant health and safety guidelines."
"Deficiency Details: The plans indicate that the building contains Group F occupancies but only a partial automatic sprinkler system is provided.

Code References: Oakland code 903.2.4 - ""An automatic sprinkler system shall be provided throughout all buildings containing Group F occupancies.""

Corrective Actions: Provide and install an automatic sprinkler system throughout the entire building to cover all areas with Group F occupancy as required by local code regulations."
"Deficiency Details: Portions of the building are not protected by fire sprinklers and lack proper separation using fire barriers.

Code References: IBC Section 707, IFC 901.4.3

Corrective Actions: Install appropriate fire barriers to separate the areas as required by code specifications in order to comply with both IBC Section 707 and IFC 901.4.3 requirements for buildings divided into multiple fire areas without full sprinkler protection."
"Deficiency Details: The expander room within the building classified under ICC occupancy class F1 and S1(2) is not equipped with sprinkler systems as required.

Code References:
- IFC 903.2.4 - This code mandates that buildings of certain occupancy classifications, such as F1 (Factory Industrial Group F, moderate-hazard) and S1(2) (Storage Group S, low hazard), must be ""sprinkled throughout"" to ensure adequate fire suppression capabilities.

Corrective Actions:
- Install an automatic sprinkler system in the expander room to comply with IFC 903.2.4 requirements.
OR
- Construct a fire separation for the expander room equivalent to that of a separate building if opting out from installing a full sprinkler system.
Note: Relying solely on clean agent initial suppression systems does not fulfill the requirement for having 'sprinkled throughout' protection; therefore, additional measures like adding overhead sprinklers should be taken in case the clean agent fails during a fire event."
"Deficiency Details:
The proposed fire separation between the R2 (residential) and F1 (factory/industrial) occupancy types does not comply with the required International Building Code (IBC) standards for a non-sprinkled building. The current design fails to provide adequate fire resistance ratings as mandated by IBC guidelines.

Code References:
- IBC 707.3.10: Specifies requirements for vertical assemblies such as walls.
- Table IBC 508.4: Outlines minimum fire-resistance rating requirements for mixed-use occupancies, indicating that a two-hour rated barrier is necessary in this context without sprinklers.
- Notes a & b of Table IBC 508.4 reference compliance with International Fire Code (IFC) section 903.3.1., which requires NFPA standard sprinkler systems [13 instead of lesser grade system like 13R].
- Footnote f from table indicates when separating different use areas within buildings, one must refer to table IBC 707 or other more restrictive measures; thus requiring potentially up to three hours' worth of protection via barriers/firewalls per Section 
706.
  
Corrective Actions:
To rectify these deficiencies:

1.- A firewall compliant with **IBC** Section **706**, capable of providing at least three hours’ worth
of structural integrity during fires should be constructed if it's intended to eliminate the requirement
for full-building sprinkler coverage under certain conditions including separate ownerships among various occupants.

2.- For Type II or V construction materials/buildings where only two-hour-rated barriers are needed,
the team needs ensure they meet all criteria set forth in *Table* ***706***.*4*, ensuring proper installation according

to specifications outlined therein regarding firerated wall assembly characteristics/functions etc..

3.- If opting out using said higher-grade Firewall thereby achieving sufficient compartmentalization/separation then an alternative residential-style automatic suppression setup may suffice i.e.: Sprinkling System conforming specifically towards ""NFPA"" Standard ""*13R*"" rather than its commercial counterpart (""*NFPA""* ""**13**"").

Lastly but importantly too - Documentation proving local Authority Having Jurisdiction ('AHJ') approval/recognition concerning how exactly aforementioned partition/wall fulfills relevant stipulations mentioned above will need provided by responsible parties involved namely here being 'Building Design Team'."
"Deficiency Details:
- The submitted plan only includes a partial system, which does not cover the entire building.
- Occupancy type for at least one floor above is unknown.
- Total building size and construction type are unspecified in the plans.

Code References:
1. IFC 2018: Section 903.2.8 - Requires an automatic sprinkler system throughout all buildings with a Group R fire area.
2. NFPA 13 (2016): Chapter 4, Section 4.1 - Mandates that buildings protected by an automatic sprinkler system must have sprinklers installed in all areas except where specific sections of this standard permit omission.

Corrective Actions:
Please submit revised plans that include the following corrections to address deficiencies noted during review:

a) Provide details on occupancy types for each floor within the structure including those floors currently unidentified or marked as 'unknown'.
b) Include information regarding total building size and specify construction types used across different parts of the premises.
c) Ensure your new submission reflects compliance with IFC section requirements pertaining to complete coverage by an automatic sprinkler system especially concerning any Group R fire areas present within your facility's layout design per code reference [IFC] provided above
d). Adhere strictly also towards ensuring full installation coverage via appropriate placement & distribution patterns according to standards set forth under NFPA guidelines; particularly noting exceptions allowed solely based upon criteria outlined explicitly therein ([NFPA]).
e). Address concerns raised through consultations held between Fire Marshal Young & Building Official Halladay about potential hazards plus life safety issues related directly toward occupant survivability scenarios should fires break out elsewhere other than covered portions thus far proposed – revise accordingly so final designs reflect holistic protection measures spanning entirety premise without exception nor compromise whatsoever"
"Deficiency Details: The submitted plans indicate a large area within the fire zone of the building that lacks sprinkler coverage. A note on these plans states ""No sprinklers required per engineer review,"" but there is no accompanying documentation to justify this exemption.

Code References:
- International Building Code (IBC): Specific reference needed for exception criteria.
- California Fire Code (CFC) 903.3: Requires automatic sprinkler systems unless exceptions are met.

Corrective Actions:
Please provide an engineering review document detailing why this particular space should be exempt from requiring a sprinkler system according to IBC standards and CFC regulations, including any relevant analysis or justification that would support such an exemption claim. Additionally, obtain approval from the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), i.e., building department review, confirming acceptance of said engineering review and its conclusions regarding code compliance exemptions."
"Deficiency Details: The design area of the system is not clearly shown for RA, specifically L1Dry Area No 1 on the working plans.

Code References: NFPA 13 23.1.3 (35)

Corrective Actions: Please provide revised working plans with an indicated scale and uniform sheet size that include a plan of each floor. Ensure these plans show the clear designation of the design area for your RA, particularly focusing on L1Dry Area No 1 as required by code reference NFPA 13 section 23.1.3 (35)."
"Deficiency Details:
The current design of Remote Area 2 is not in compliance with the required standards for light hazard protection. The area designated as a remote area has been adjusted to only cover an area of 454 ft², which does not meet the minimum requirement.

Code References:
NFPA 13: Section 19.3.3.2 - This section outlines that for light hazard occupancies, before any adjustments are made, a standard remote area size should be using at least 1500 ft².

Corrective Actions:
Please revise your sprinkler system layout by adjusting the coverage of Remote Area 2 to include at least the minimum required footprint of 1500 ft² prior to making any further adjustments or reductions based on specific room conditions or obstructions.
Additionally, ensure that walls within this space extend all way up so they can qualify and function correctly under room design protocol; otherwise adjust accordingly if it's determined there will be no full compartmentalization due to partial wall height.
Once these changes have been implemented re-evaluate your fire suppression system against NFPA requirements ensuring proper application throughout.Remote Area needs recalculating from base square footage without premature reduction factors applied until after initial conformity established per code guidance provided above"
"Deficiency Details:
The fire protection plans for remote area L7 RA2 indicate that the sprinkler system design is based on an 18 x 18 coverage. However, upon inspection, it was found that the actual spacing of sprinklers in some rooms exceeds this designed specification with instances where they are spaced more than 9 feet from walls.

Code References:
- NFPA 13 (Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems) may have specific requirements regarding maximum distance between wall and nearest sprinkler head as well as maximum floor area per single head.
  
Corrective Actions: 
There are two potential corrective actions to resolve this deficiency:

1. Adjust calculations - Recalculate the hydraulic design using a revised layout based on a larger grid size such as a 20 x 20-foot coverage pattern which would require different flow rates and pressures; specifically utilizing at least a minimum of 20 gallons per minute (gpm) at no less than16.7 pounds per square inch (psi).

OR

2. Modify sprinkler locations – Reconfigure or add additional sprinkle heads within these spaces so that their placement complies with original plan specifications ensuring none exceed being placed further than nine feet away from any wall thus maintaining proper distribution patterns according to initial designs without needing new hydraulic calculations.

It's important to note both solutions should be evaluated by qualified professionals who will ensure compliance with all applicable codes while also considering factors like water supply availability before implementation can occur safely effectively resolving identified deficiencies in accordance current standards regulations governing automatic fire suppression systems installations within buildings structures alike"
"Deficiency Details:
The garage is equipped with an NFPA 13 system, which differs from the design standard proposed for the rest of the building (NFPA 13R). There needs to be proper separation between occupancies in both vertical and horizontal aspects.

Code References:
- NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems
- NFPA 13R: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems in Low-Rise Residential Occupancies
- IBC (International Building Code): Relevant sections that address occupancy separations

Corrective Actions:
Ensure that there is a clear distinction and appropriate fire barrier installations as required by code between different occupancy types within mixed-use buildings. This may involve installing additional fire-rated walls or floors/ceilings assemblies to achieve compliance with both IBC requirements and either NFPA 13 or NPFA 13R standards depending on each area's designated use. Consultation with a qualified engineer or architect who specializes in life safety systems should be sought out to ensure all local codes are met during this process."
"Deficiency Details:
The system area of operation is not currently increased by 30 percent as required for certain types of sprinklers used on sloped ceilings with a pitch exceeding 1 in 6. This deficiency applies to non-storage applications where the slope corresponds to a rise of two units over a run of twelve units, or equivalently, has a roof slope percentage equaling approximately 16.7%.

Code References:
NFPA 13: Section [11.2.3.2.4] - The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standard outlines that specific adjustments must be made when using particular types and configurations of fire protection sprinkler systems.

Corrective Actions:
To correct this deficiency:

1) Verify if the type(s) of installed spray sprinklers are among those listed under NFPA standards section [8.4.3(4)], including extended coverage and quick-response models.
   
2) If applicable, adjust the design calculations for these areas so that there's an increase in operational coverage by at least thirty percent without altering existing density requirements.

It may require consultation with qualified professionals who specialize in fire suppression systems' design and installation according to NFPA guidelines to ensure compliance effectively while maintaining safety protocols within affected spaces."
"Deficiency Details:
- The calculation sheet specifies a coverage area for sprinklers of 196 square feet with spacing set at 14x14.
- Actual plans show heads in the specified area covering between 214 to 247 square feet, and spaced at approximately 15.5 x 15.5.
- RA250 is noted as having a spacing requirement of16 x16; however, installed heads exceed this by reaching spacings up to16'7"".
-R A100's installation has head spacings that are greater than the required14x14.

Code References: 
[Specific code references would be provided here based on local fire codes or NFPA standards (e.g., NFPA13) which dictate maximum floor areas per sprinkler head and maximum distances between them.]

Corrective Actions:
1. Provide recalculated documentation showing compliance with an18x18spacing layout if it meets code requirements for the occupancy hazard classification.
2.Or adjust existing sprinkler layouts so they do not exceed their designated coverage areas according to calculations initially stated on plan sheets (i.e., reduce spaces from current measurements back down towards those indicated such as196SqFtand/or closer adherence tora tedspac ingssuchas1414or1616)."
"Deficiency Details:
Remote area 3 is calculated for coverage based on a 16x16 ft. layout with an output of 13 gallons per minute (gpm) at a pressure of 7 pounds per square inch (psi). However, the remote area and heads in other areas are required to have a coverage capability consistent with a larger standard, specifically that of a 20 x 20 ft. layout.

Code References:
- Reliable Bulletin No.135
- NFPA Standard: NFPA 13 Section [11.3.1.1*]

Corrective Actions:
The sprinkler system design must be reviewed and adjusted so that all areas including Remote Area #3 meet or exceed the minimum requirement for fire suppression effectiveness as specified by code references; this includes ensuring proper water distribution achieving at least the necessary flow rate of not less than twenty gallons per minute (20 gpm) at no less than sixteen point seven pounds per square inch (16.7 psi), which corresponds to RA3516 sprinkler specifications when covering an area measuring twenty feet by twenty feet."
"Deficiency Details:
The fire sprinkler system design currently shows a head that requires 24 psi and 28 gpm, which is significantly higher than the requirements for Reliable RA3513 heads designed for a 16 x 16 spacing. The specified model only needs 7.6 psi and 16 gpm.

Code References:
NFPA13 (National Fire Protection Association Standard) - Installation of Sprinkler Systems could be referenced to ensure proper selection of sprinklers based on their specifications such as pressure requirement and flow rate in relation to area coverage.

Corrective Actions:
Please review the current fire protection layout plans to confirm if Reliable RA3513 heads are being used throughout all units or clarify what type/model of heads requiring the noted high-pressure settings has been selected instead. If there's an inconsistency with using different types/models across various areas, adjust accordingly so that each unit complies with its intended design criteria—utilizing either all Reliable RA3513s at correct spacings or providing justification/documentation for any alternative selections made."
"Deficiency Details: Sidewall Head Coverage - On the 4th floor, HSW (Horizontal Side Wall) sprinklers are designed for a spacing of 16x18 feet.

1. Adjust placement/installation so that all sprinkler deflectors are within 36” vertically below peaks as per [NFPA 13D:8.1]. 
   
2.Show detailed sections indicating locations of such sprinklers relative to peaks, ensuring they meet minimum distance requirements specified by applicable codes.

3.Confirm and document whether current designs account for changes in designated areas caused by slopes according to [NFPA 13D:10]."
"Deficiency Details: Areas subject to freezing are not equipped with dry type sprinkler heads. Additionally, if garages are heated, this information is not indicated on the plans.

Code References:
- NFPA 13: Section 15.3

Corrective Actions:
1. Ensure that all areas prone to freezing temperatures have dry type sprinkler heads installed.
2. If any garage spaces are heated, clearly show this detail on the fire protection system plans.
3. Replace any wet-type sprinkler heads in unheated garage areas with dry type heads as required by code compliance for freeze protection measures"
"Deficiency Details:
- The system has been designed for head coverage of 16 x 18 feet at a flow rate of 31 gallons per minute (gpm) and pressure of 28.6 pounds per square inch (psi), specifically for the Reliable F1Res58 R3533 sprinkler head.
- Several rooms have been identified where the spacing between heads exceeds the maximum allowable distance, resulting in areas with insufficient fire suppression coverage.

Code References:
- NFPA13 Standard for Installation: This standard typically outlines requirements regarding proper design specifications including but not limited to, appropriate distances between fire sprinklers based on their listing limitations which is generally provided by manufacturers' cut sheets or listings.

Corrective Actions:
1. Adjust Head Spacing - Reconfigure existing layout to ensure that no area within protected spaces exceed an inter-sprinkler distance greater than what's allowed by manufacturer’s guidelines; this may involve adding additional heads or repositioning current ones.
2. Alternative Sprinkler Heads - If adjusting spacing does not provide adequate solution due to structural constraints or other factors, consider selecting alternative models capable of providing compliant coverages over larger areas as needed while still meeting required performance criteria such as discharge patterns and pressures.
3. Recalculate System Design – After making adjustments either through changing spacings or replacing with different types/models of heads, perform new hydraulic calculations ensuring all affected zones meet minimum water delivery standards necessary for effective firefighting operations under revised layouts/conditions according to code compliance regulations outlined in NFPA13.

Please note that any changes made should be reviewed and approved by a qualified engineer familiar with local codes and standards before implementation into actual practice."

"Deficiency Details:
The sectional analysis indicates that the wood joist construction may be classified as obstructed due to insufficient open space between members. The panels measure 30 inches on centers spaced at 24 inches, resulting in a total area of 720 square inches. However, when considering the combined area occupied by both chords and webs within this section, it exceeds the allowable limit of obstruction which is set at less than or equal to 70% openness.

Code References:
NFPA 13: Section [3.7.2*] - This code reference specifies requirements for obstructions related to sprinkler system installation where certain criteria define whether a space is considered ""obstructed"" based on its configuration and percentage of blockage.

Corrective Actions:
To address this deficiency:

1) Re-evaluate the orientation of webs and chords since their arrangement can significantly impact calculations regarding obstruction.
2) If necessary, modify structural elements such as re-spacing or resizing either web members or chord components so that they comply with NFPA standards ensuring an open-space ratio greater than or equal to seventy percent (≥70%) unblocked.
3) Consult with a fire protection engineer if there are any uncertainties about how these changes might affect overall building safety systems compliance before implementing modifications.
4) After making adjustments according to NFPA guidelines ensure proper documentation reflecting updated design specifications for future inspections/reference purposes confirming adherence standard's requirement concerning non-obstruction around sprinklers installations areas per defined codes sections mentioned above respectively ."

"Deficiency Details: The standpipe system is missing visible floor clamps, the penetration hole size for the pipes has not been specified, flexible couplings are not within 24 inches below the floor in multistory buildings as required. Additionally, there's a lack of piping supports and seismic bracing.

Code References:
- NFPA 13: Section 9.3.2.3.1 - This section specifies that flexible couplings should be located within 24 inches (610 mm) below the floor level in multi-story buildings.
- NFPA 14: Section 6.1* - Outlines requirements for pipe support and seismic bracing to ensure stability during an earthquake or similar event.

Corrective Actions:
To address these deficiencies,
1) Install appropriate-sized floor clamps at regular intervals along with each vertical run of standpipe to secure it properly.
2) Ensure that all penetrations made by standpipes through floors have holes sized according to code specifications allowing proper fitting without compromising structural integrity or fire resistance ratings.
3) Position flexible couplings so they are no more than two feet beneath every penetrated-floor level throughout multistory structures ensuring compliance with movement accommodation regulations set forth by NFPA standards.
4) Review current installation against codes regarding piping supports; add additional hangers/supports where necessary following manufacturer recommendations and standard spacing guidelines provided by applicable codes such as those from ASME B31 series on pressure pipings if relevant here too depending upon specific building services involved besides firefighting water supply lines alone which might also need consideration under same ruleset potentially even though primary focus remains fixed onto latter due its critical nature concerning life safety measures primarily above everything else always first foremost before anything else whatsoever period end story full stop amen!
5 ) Implement comprehensive seismic restraint systems designed specifically tailored towards this particular structure’s unique characteristics taking into account local geological data plus historical records related past earthquakes nearby vicinity etcetera thus enabling better preparation ahead next one whenever happens hopefully never but just case still good idea prepare anyway because you can't predict future after all right? Right!"

"Deficiency Details: The capacity of the water supply system is currently insufficient to meet the fire flow demand and duration requirements. Although a fire pump is present, there is no storage tank indicated in the documentation or plans provided. It remains unclear whether there exists an on-site water storage facility capable of meeting these demands, or if reliance has been placed solely upon city-supplied water without verification that it can fulfill required durations.

Code References: NFPA 13: 11.1.5.2

Corrective Actions:
1) Verify if an on-site water storage tank exists; provide detailed schematics showing its connection with the existing fire protection systems.
2) If no such storage facility exists, assess whether city-supplied water alone meets both flow rate and duration requirements as per code specifications.
3) Should city-water not suffice for either criterion (flow rates/duration), consider installing a dedicated onsite-storage solution designed specifically to satisfy said deficiencies.
4) Ensure all modifications comply with NFPA standards by consulting with local authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ).
5) Update all relevant documents including drawings/plans/specifications accordingly after implementing corrective measures ensuring they reflect current site conditions post-modification(s)."

"Deficiency Details:
The fire protection plan on Level 8, as indicated in Sheet FP-108, shows three sprinkler heads being supplied by a separate system located on a different floor within the same compartment. This configuration undermines the functionality of floor control valves and may lead to confusion during emergency response situations where firefighters could react to an incorrect floor indication. Additionally, this setup complicates servicing and maintenance activities due to ambiguity regarding which system serves specific heads.

Code References:
NFPA 13 (Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems) requires that each sprinkled area be provided with appropriate controls and indications so that systems can be effectively managed both during emergencies and routine maintenance [specific code sections would need referencing based upon year/version applicable].

Corrective Actions:
To rectify this issue:

1. Reconfigure the piping layout such that all sprinklers on Level 8 are fed from their respective system designated for said level.
2. Ensure proper labeling is applied according to NFPA standards so it's clear which control valve corresponds with its associated zone or compartment.
3. Update plans including Sheet FP-108 accordingly after modifications have been made.
4. Conduct testing post-modification work completion per NFPA guidelines ensuring correct operation across affected areas/systems.

Please note: The exact corrective actions should comply with local codes/ordinances along with any additional requirements set forth by authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ)."
